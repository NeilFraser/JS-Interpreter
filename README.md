RayScript
=========

Hello there, this is Alex Mckenley.
I am a big fan of Ray, so I decided to make a Javascript-interpreted language called RayScript. If you don't know who Ray is...well where the hell have you been! He's only the coolest person ever! Checkout alexmckenley.github.io/div-pics to find out who Ray is!
